			<h1 class="section-header">Summary</h1>
			<p>Mercs was a game created in the IAT410 class. Our team chose to create a turn-based JRPG style game for PC which encorporated elements of hero collector games often found on the mobile game market. I was in charge of game design and was a part of development. Above is a trailer for the game.</p>

			<h1 class="section-header">Process</h1>
		    <p>The first step we took in creating this game was to come up with a premise. The members of my team were all familiar with RPG games, and so we decided to create something in that realm as it was the type of game that we were the most knowledgeable on. After deciding on the premise, we brainstormed ideas a narrative and mechanics that would work well with the narrative.<br><br>

    		The next step was to begin development after confirming that everyone was on the same page. The process went something like:<br><br>1. Together, decide on what's being worked on for the week and how things should be.<br>2. Split off and individually work on our resposibilities.<br>3. Come together and combine parts.<br>4. Test it.<br><br>We worked in unity, and I created a prototype of the game so that we could play test the core mechanics to see if the game would even be fun before we committed to it. After the first round of playtesting, we continued to work on the game in parts. That way we could continue playtesting and incorporate feedback as we worked. Eventually, we had a full playable version of the game.</p>

		    <h1 class="section-header">Challenges</h1>
		    <p>The main challenge with this project was that we were too ambitious for the scope of this project. For the timeframe we were given (roughly 2 months), we tried to incorporate too many mechanics as we only had one artist and coder. We had to cut out parts such as the ability to do silmutaneous quests and a detailed and interactive map. This resulted in a gameplay experience that was lacking. Therefore, I had to redesign the gameplay around the mechanics that we were able to implement, such as combat. I ended up shifting the game from click-based pathfinding on an open world to instanced tile-based maps.</p>
